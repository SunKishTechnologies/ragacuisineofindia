<h2>Testimonials</h2>
<p>"My favorite Indian restaurant in the Seattle area, Raga offers much more favorable ambiance than any of the others I've been to and that alone may make the food seem better. If you have an adventerous palate this is a great destination for introducing yourself to a new world of flavors." </p>
<p>"This fantastic Indian restaurant is, reputedly, Bill Gates' favorite. I have never personally seen him there, but I can vouch for his taste if it is. Raga is fantastic Indian food and their new location in downtown Kirkland has lovely ambiance and fairly reasonable prices. I recommend the lunch buffet if you would like to try a lot of options at once. Just don't get there close to when they are shutting it down, they will absolutely close in front of your eyes if you get there one minute too late." </p>
<p>"Outstanding restaurant! Raga has the winning combination of excellent food and attentive, quality service. We go as a group of four, and share the dishes we select. Every single plate I've had is excellent! And these are distinctive entrees -- it's not one of those restaurants where every plate has the same sauce or seasonings. The cooks here know what they're doing. The service is first-rate, and the prices are good. Two little tidbits: as for white wine, they didn't have a Gris/Grigio on their winelist (a blunder IMHO since Chardonnay & tangy Indian food don't blend well on the palate), so you might call and ask if you can bring your own if this is important to you. Second tidbit: the parking situation in downtown Kirkland can be very challenging, especially on a Friday or Saturday night. Give yourself an extra 15 minutes to find parking on a residential side street to the north of Raga, and then enjoy a pleasant stroll down to the restaurant. Leave time before or after to browse the art galleries too. Bon appetite!"</p>
